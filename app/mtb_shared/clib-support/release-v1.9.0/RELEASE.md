Minimum required ModusToolbox™ Software Environment: v3.6

### LLVM ARM Compiler and printf
The LLVM ARM toolchain utilizes the picolibc library.

Because of the implementation in which picolibc handles printf calls, in the context of RTOS applications, it is up to the application to provide thread safety for printf statements when multiple threads share the same stream.
